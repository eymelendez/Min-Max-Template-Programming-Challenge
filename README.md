# Min-Max-Template-Programming-Challenge

First Template Code that we did in CECS 3212 Data Structures

3.     Minimum/Maximum Templates 
 
Write templates for the two functions  minimum  and  maximum . The  minimum  function should accept two arguments 
and return the value of the argument that is the lesser of the two. The  maximum  function should accept two 
arguments and return the value of the argument that is the greater of the two. Design a simple driver program 
that demonstrates the templates with various data types.
